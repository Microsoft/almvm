## Overview

**GitHub** is a web based **Git** version control repository hosting service which offers distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git.

Azure DevOps provides a first-class support for **Git** with several advantages including

* Unlimited free private repositories
* Powerful code reviews
* Advanced branch policies
* Integrated CI/CD pipeline
* Semantic code search

The primary difference between the two is that Azure DevOps is focused on closed source projects and GitHub is focused more on open source projects. GitHub offers both private and public repositories. However, it doesn't have an integrated build server.

Teams can overcome this shortfall by using Azure DevOps as a continuous integration platform for GitHub.

### What's covered in this lab

In this hands-on lab, we will introduce you to open source DevOps using **GitHub, Azure DevOps** and **Azure**. You will learn how to deploy an **ASP.Net** application to Azure App Service using CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps with code repository in GitHub. We will cover the following steps:

* Forking project repository to your GitHub account
* Linking GitHub account to Azure DevOps
* Editing the existing build definition to include source code from GitHub
* Configuring build Triggers
* Executing Build

### Prerequisites for the lab

1. **Microsoft Azure Account**: You will need a valid and active Azure account for the Azure labs. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/){:target="_blank"}

    * If you are an active Visual Studio Subscriber, you are entitled for a $50-$150 credit per month. You can refer to this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/){:target="_blank"} to find out more information about this including how to activate and start using your monthly Azure credit.

    * If you are not a Visual Studio Subscriber, you can sign up for the FREE [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/){:target="_blank"} program to create an **Azure free account** (includes 1 year of free services, $200 for 1st month).

1. You will need an **Azure DevOps Organization**. If you do not have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs){:target="_blank"}


1. A **GitHub** account. Create a new account from [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home){:target="_blank"}.

## Setting up the code repository on GitHub

There are multiple ways to add code to a GitHub repository. We can start with a new empty repository and manually add files, commit and push. But for the purpose of this lab, we will ***Fork*** an existing repository. A *Fork* is nothing but a copy of a repository.  When we *Fork*, we are creating a personal copy of the repository - any changes that we make will not affect the original code. If we want  to contribute back to the original, you can submit a *Pull Request*

1. Let us go to [**GitHub**](http://www.github.com){:target="_blank"} and make sure we are logged in with our GitHub user account.

1. Let us navigate to the [**PartsUnlimitedE2E**](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedE2E){:target="_blank"} repository and select **Fork** to our GitHub account.

## Exercise 1: Connecting Azure DevOps to GitHub repository

1. In the Azure DevOps home page, click on the **Project settings** gear icon and then click on **Service connections** option to navigate to the **Service connections** screen.
Click on **+New Service Endpoint** dropdown and select the **Github** option. 

   ![VSTS Demo Generator](images/endpoint1_3.png)

   {% include important.html content= "We will need to specify what authorization method you want to provide. If we choose **Grant Authorization**, the default option, as the authorization method, the dialog shows an **Authorize** button that opens the GitHub login page. If we select **Personal access token**, we must obtain a suitable token and paste it into the Token textbox. The dialog shows the recommended scopes for the token: ***repo, user, admin:repo_hook***. See [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/){:target=\"_blank\"} on GitHub for information about obtaining an access token." %}

1. Select **Grant Authorization**. Click on the **Authorize** button which opens the **GitHub login page**.

   We will follow the steps required by GitHub to authorize access to our account.

## Exercise 4: Triggering CI and CD

Navigate to your forked GitHub repository. Let's make a simple change in the code to trigger the CI build.

1. From your forked GitHub repository, open the file **Index.cshtml** under **master** branch by navigating to the below path-

   >PartsUnlimitedE2E/PartsUnlimited-aspnet45/src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/Views/Home/Index.cshtml

   ![13](images/PartsUnlimitedE2E12.png)

   ![14](images/14.png)

1. Edit the code. For this example, let's change **line 28** to increase discount from **50%** to **70%**.

1. Navigate to **Preview changes**, enter a commit message and click on **Commit Changes**.

   ![15](images/15.png)

1. The code commit will trigger a CI build. Go to the **Build** tab in your Azure DevOps project to see the CI build in progress. Click on ellipsis to **View build results**.

   ![30](images/buildprog1_6.png)

1. Once the build is complete, you will see the summary which shows **Test Results** and **Code Coverage**.

1. Navigate to the **Dev** environment and you will see 2 tasks are used. Let us explore the tasks.

    ![29](images/release17.png)

    * **Azure Resource Group Deployment**: The project used in this lab has the **Azure App service** as its front-end and **Azure SQL DB service** as its back-end. We will provision these services as [PAAS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/){:target="_blank"} on Azure using [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template){:target="_blank"}. This task will create the above services in a resource group.

    * **Azure App Service Deploy**: The task is used to deploy a Web project to the Azure App Service created above.


1. Once the release is complete click on **Logs**, you will see the task-wise summary.

    ![35](images/release1_8.png)

    ![36](images/releasesucc1_1.png)
