## Overview 
Azure Key Vault helps teams to securely store and manage sensitive information such as keys, password, certificates, etc. in a centralized storage which are safeguarded by industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and even hardware security modules. This prevents information exposure through source code,  a common mistake that many developers make. Many developers leave sensitive information such as database connection strings, passwords, private keys, etc. in their source code which when gained by malicious users can result in undesired consequences. Access to a key vault requires proper authentication and authorization and with RBAC, teams can have even fine granular control who has what permissions over the sensitive data.

## Whatâ€™s covered in this lab
In this lab, you will see how you can use Azure Key Vault in a pipeline

1. We will create a key vault, from the Azure portal, to store a MySQL server password
1. We will configure permissions to let a service principal to read the value
1. We will retrieve the password in an Azure pipeline and passed on to subsequent tasks
