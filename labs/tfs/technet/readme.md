# Microsoft TechNet Virtual Labs

[Microsoft TechNet Virtual Labs](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/virtuallabs) provides a quick and easy way to evaluate and test Microsoftâ€™s newest products and technologies through virtual environments that do not require any complex setup or installation. You can use virtual labs online immediately for free :)

The ALM VM 2017 (Winter Update) and the corresponding labs are now available on TechNet Virtual Labs which means you can try them from a browser or a windows client without having to worry about downloading the entire virtual machine.

***Note: TechNet infrastructure is not designed for classroom trainings. There is a concurrency limit for the labs. Should you want to use them in a classroom, please contact the [Learning On-Demand](mailto:lodslabs@microsoft.com?Subject=TechNet%20labs%20for%20classroom%20usage) team
