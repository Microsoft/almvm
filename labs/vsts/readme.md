## Overview

We are working on providing hands-on-labs for Visual Studio Team Services. Here are a few labs, for a start. 

In order to complete these labs you will need 

- **Visual Studio Team Services account**: If you don't have one, you can sign up for one, from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">here</a>

- **Microsoft Azure Account**: You will need a valid and active Azure account for the Azure labs. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

    - If you are a Visual Studio Active Subscriber, you are entitled for a $50-$150 credit per month. You can refer to this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) to find out more including how to activate and start using your monthly Azure credit.

    - If you are not a Visual Studio Subscriber, you can sign up for the FREE [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/) program to create **Azure free account** (includes 1 yr of free services, $200 for 1st month).

- You can use the **[Visual Studio Team Services Demo Data generator](https://vstsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net)** to provision a project with pre-defined data on to your Visual Studio Team Services account. Please use the ***My Health Clinic*** template to follow the hands-on-labs.

If you are not using the VSTS Demo Data Generator, you can clone the code from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/myhealthclinic2017)

## Working with VSTS DemoGenerator

### Overview

Before you start:

- You will need a Visual Studio Team Services account - if you do not have one, you can 
<a href="http://bit.ly/2dwMwYR">create</a> one now

4. Some templates may require additional extensions to be installed to your VSTS account. The system will check if these extensions are already installed. A green tick before the extension means that the extension is already installed. If the extensions needs to be installed, you can select the extension which will take you to the page on Visual Studio Team Services Marketplace, from where you can  install the extension.
