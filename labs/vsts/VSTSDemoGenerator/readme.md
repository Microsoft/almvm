## Overview

Visual Studio Team Services Demo Generator helps you create projects on your Visual Studio Team Services account with preset sample content which includes source code, work items, service endpoints, build and release definitions based on a template you choose.

The purpose of this system is to help follow hands-on-labs, demos and other education material provided by the Microsoft Visual Studio marketing team.

Before you start:

- You will need a Personal Access Token for the account. An overview of PAT with instructions to create is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate)

1. Some templates may require additional extensions to be installed to your VSTS account. The system will check if these extensions are already installed. A green tick before the extension means that the extension is already installed. If the extensions needs to be installed, you can select the extension which will take you to the page on Visual Studio Team Services Marketplace, from where you can  install the extension.
